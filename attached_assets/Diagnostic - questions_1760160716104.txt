Here are the critical UX Details to Get Right:
1. Smooth Animations
- Questions should slide/fade in (not pop)
- Answered questions should condense slightly but remain readable
- Auto-scroll to new question (but not too aggressively)

2. Clear Visual States
Answered question:
- Slightly reduced opacity or size
- Shows selected answer clearly
- Has subtle "Edit" indicator on hover

Active question:
- Full size, prominent
- Clear focus state
- Animation draws attention

Unanswered questions below:
- Invisible/hidden until previous is answered

3. Editing Mechanism
- Click on any previous answer to edit
- Active question collapses
- Clicked question expands back to full size
Save change → returns to where you were


4. Smart Scrolling
- Auto-scroll should be gentle
- Leave previous question partially visible at top
- Don't scroll too far past the new question
- On mobile: ensure keyboard doesn't hide content

5. Add a sticky summary card that builds as they answer:
[Sticky at top-right]
Your Plan So Far - example:
✓ CISSP certification
✓ Beginner level
✓ AI-guided focus
⏱️ 12 weeks


6. Add a sticky visual progress bar as they answer
